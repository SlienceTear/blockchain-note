[Balancer White Paper](https://balancer.fi/whitepaper.pdf)

1. If the pool owner does not add or remove tokens to/from the pool, token balances can only change through trades.
2. The price of tokens being bought by the trader (token 0) to increase and price of tokens being sold by the trader (token i) to decrease. 
3. One can prove that whenever external market prices are different from those offered by a Balancer Pool, an arbitrageur will make the most prot by trading with that pool until its prices equal those on the external market.
